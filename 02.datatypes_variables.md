## Data Types in JavaScript

Hereâ€™s the updated table with information about whether each data type is **mutable** or **immutable**:
### **Explanation:**
- **Immutable types**: Their values cannot be changed after creation.  
- **Mutable types**: Their contents can be modified after creation (e.g., objects and arrays).
----
- **Primitive types** are the basic data types that are **immutable** and are **stored by value**. Each primitive type represents a single value.
- **Non-Primitive (Reference)** types are more complex and are **mutable**. They can store collections of values or more complex entities. These types are **stored by reference**, meaning that variables refer to the memory address where the data is stored.


| **Data Type**      | **Immutable**| **Storage Type** | **Description**                                                                   |                   
|--------------------|--------------|------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **`Number`**        | Yes         | value     | integer or floating-point numbers, including `+Infinity`, `-Infinity`, and `NaN`.                          |           
| **`String`**        | Yes         | value     | textual data enclosed in single, double, or backticks (template literals).                                               |           
| **`Boolean`**       | Yes         | value     | logical entity: `true` or `false`.                                          |           
| **`null`**           | Yes        | value     | an intentional absence of any object value.                                   |           
| **`undefined`**    | Yes         | value      | variable that has been declared but not assigned a value.                    |           
| **`BigInt`**        | Yes         | value     | large integers with arbitrary precision (greater than the limit of `Number`). |           
| **`Symbol`**        | Yes         | value     | unique and immutable value, often used for object property keys.            |           
| **`Object`**        | Yes         | reference | collection of key-value pairs (e.g., objects, arrays, functions).           |           
| **`Array`**         | Yes         | reference | type of object used to store ordered collections of data (indexed by numbers).         |           
| **`Function`**      | Yes         | reference | block of code designed to perform a specific task.
