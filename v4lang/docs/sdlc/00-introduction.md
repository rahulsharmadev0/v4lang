# Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) ‚Äì Introduction

> The Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) is a standardized, step-by-step process used to develop software applications. It ensures quality, predictability, and efficiency in software projects.

## üö© Why is SDLC Important?

The SDLC framework provides numerous benefits for software development projects:

- **Budget clarity:** Prevents overspending and surprises by establishing clear cost estimates upfront
- **Resource planning:** Defines the number and type of engineers needed for each phase
- **Documentation:** Ensures all supporting documents are identified and created systematically
- **Timeline:** Sets clear delivery expectations and milestones for stakeholders
- **Quality:** Reduces risk of poor software quality through structured processes and reviews

## üìö Types of SDLC Models

There are several SDLC models, each with its own approach and methodology:

1. **Waterfall Model** - Sequential, linear approach
2. **Spiral Model** - Risk-driven iterative approach
3. **V & V Model** - Verification and validation focused
4. **Prototype Model** - Early prototype development
5. **Customized Model** - Tailored to specific project needs
6. **Hybrid Model** - Combination of multiple approaches
7. **Agile Model** - Iterative and incremental development

## üè¢ Service-Based vs. Product-Based Companies

Understanding the difference between service-based and product-based companies is crucial as it affects how SDLC is implemented:

| **Feature** | **Service-Based Company** | **Product-Based Company** |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Core Business** | Develops software for clients | Designs and sells its own products |
| **Requirement Role** | BA collects requirements from customer | Product Analyst designs requirements from market research |
| **Source Code** | No rights to keep/sell code | Full rights to keep/sell code |
| **Revenue Model** | Project-based billing | Product sales and licensing |
| **Customer Relationship** | Direct client interaction | End-user focused |

## Next Steps

In the following sections, we'll dive deep into the most commonly used SDLC model - the **Waterfall Model** - and explore its phases, advantages, and disadvantages in detail.
