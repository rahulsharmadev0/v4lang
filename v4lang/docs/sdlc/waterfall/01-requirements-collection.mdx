# üìã Phase 1: Requirements Collection



Requirements collection is the **foundation** of any software project. This phase involves gathering, analyzing, and documenting what the software needs to accomplish.

**Gathering requirements directly from the customer** to understand their business needs and translate them into software specifications.

### 1. Functional Requirements

:::success Definition
**What the system should do** - The core features and functionality
:::

```typescript title="Examples:"
// User Management
- User authentication and authorization
- User profile management
- Role-based access control

// Data Operations
- Data processing capabilities
- CRUD operations
- Data validation and sanitization

// Business Logic
- Business rule implementation
- Workflow automation
- Integration with external systems
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="non-functional" label="‚ö° Non-Functional">

### 2. Non-Functional Requirements

:::success Definition
**How the system should perform** - Quality attributes and constraints
:::

```typescript title="Examples:"
// Performance Requirements
- Response time < 2 seconds for 95% of requests
- Support 10,000 concurrent users
- Database query optimization
- Caching strategies

// Security Requirements
- Data encryption at rest and in transit
- Multi-factor authentication
- Regular security audits
- GDPR/CCPA compliance

// Usability Requirements
- Responsive design for mobile devices
- Accessibility compliance (WCAG 2.1)
- Intuitive user interface
- Multi-language support

// Reliability Requirements
- 99.9% uptime SLA
- Automated backup and recovery

```

1. **Thorough Initial Analysis:**\
  Spend adequate time in requirement gathering and stakeholder interviews
2. **Clear Documentation:**\
  Ensure all requirements are well-documented with examples and acceptance criteria
3. **Stakeholder Alignment:**\
  Get formal sign-off from all key stakeholders before proceeding
4. **Change Management Process:**\
  Establish a formal process for handling requirement changes with impact analysis
5. **Regular Reviews:**\
  Conduct periodic requirement validation sessions with stakeholders

  ‚úÖ Do's
</h3>

- **Involve all relevant stakeholders** early and often
- **Document everything clearly** with examples and visuals
- **Validate requirements regularly** through reviews and prototypes
- **Use visual aids** (diagrams, mockups, wireframes)
- **Prioritize requirements** (must-have vs. nice-to-have)
- **Consider edge cases** and error scenarios
- **Establish clear acceptance criteria** for each requirement
