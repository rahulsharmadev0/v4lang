# üíß Waterfall Model Overview

The **Waterfall Model** is a sequential, step-by-step process for software development. It progresses through distinct stages in a linear fashion, where each phase must be completed before moving to the next.

## Why is it called the Waterfall Model?

The model gets its name from the way it flows downward through phases, similar to a waterfall:

- **No backtracking:** Once a phase is complete, you cannot go back to previous phases
- **Sequential flow:** Each phase flows into the next in a predetermined order
- **Requirement stability:** Requirement changes are not allowed mid-cycle
- **Rigid structure:** Not flexible; leads to longer delivery times but ensures thorough planning

### 1. Requirement Collection
- **Process:** Gathering requirements directly from the customer.
- **Roles:** `Business Analyst (BA)` or `Product Analyst`
- **BA Role:** Acts as a bridge between the customer and the software company, translating business needs into software requirements.
- **Who can be a BA?** Experienced domain experts (10‚Äì15 years).
- **Note:** For small projects, a developer may collect requirements.

### 2. Feasibility Study/Analysis
- **Process:** Assessing if the project is viable.
- **Roles:** `Project Manager (PM)`, `BA`, `Architect`, `Finance`, `HR`
- **PM:** Makes the final decision to accept or reject the project.
- **Architect:** Decides on technologies.
- **Finance:** Estimates budget.
- **HR:** Checks resource availability.

### 3. Design
- **Process:** Creating the application's architecture.
- **HLD (High-Level Design):** Architectural overview (e.g., main modules like Login, Home, Cart).
- **LLD (Low-Level Design):** Detailed design of each module (e.g., logic, database tables).
- **Roles:** `Architect`, `Software Developer`

### 4. Coding (Implementation)
- **Process:** Developers write code based on the design.
- **Roles:** `Senior Developer`, `Junior Developer`, `Freshers`

### 5. Testing
- **Process:** Testers validate the software against requirements using test cases (Black Box Testing).
- **Roles:** `Senior Tester`, `Junior Tester`, `Freshers`
- **Why not developers?**
  - Developers may be overconfident or biased.
  - They may miss negative scenarios or hide defects.
  - Focus is on development, not testing.
  - Leads to quality issues and time waste.

### 6. Installation/Implementation
- **Process:** IT Engineers install the software at the customer site and provide a demo.
- **Roles:** `Installation Engineer`, `Implementation Engineer`, `Field Engineer`, `Site Engineer`

### 7. Maintenance
- **Process:** Ongoing support (typically 6‚Äì9 months). Defects found by the customer are fixed free of charge.
- **Roles:** Smaller team of developers and testers.

## Core Characteristics

### üîí Fixed Requirements
- All requirements must be gathered and finalized at the beginning
- Changes during development are costly and discouraged
- Provides stability and predictability for planning

### üìã Phase-Gate Approach
- Each phase has specific deliverables and criteria
- Progress is measured by phase completion
- Quality gates ensure standards are met before proceeding

### üìä Predictable Timeline
- Clear milestones and deadlines
- Easy to estimate project duration
- Suitable for projects with well-understood requirements

## ‚ùì When to Use Waterfall Model

The Waterfall model works best when:

- Requirements are well-defined and unlikely to change
- Technology is well-understood and stable
- Project scope is clearly defined
- Client has clear vision of the final product
- Regulatory compliance requires extensive documentation

## ‚ùì Why is it called the Waterfall Model?
- No backtracking: Once a phase is complete, you cannot go back.
- Requirement changes are not allowed mid-cycle.
- Not flexible; leads to longer delivery times.

## ‚ùì Why do customers keep changing requirements?
- Market competition
- Business changes
- Technology updates


## ü§î Advantages & Disadvantages

| **Advantages** | **Disadvantages** |
| :--- | :--- |
| Quality is high since requirements are fixed | Requirement changes are not allowed |
| Easy to adapt | Developers may be forced to test their own code |
| Total investment is low | Not flexible |
|  | Turnaround time is high |
|  | Backtracking is not possible |



## ü§î Service-Based vs Product-Based Company

| **Feature** | **Service-Based Company** | **Product-Based Company** |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Core Business | Develops software for clients | Designs and sells its own products |
| Requirement Role | BA collects requirements from customer | Product Analyst designs requirements from market research |
| Source Code | No rights to keep/sell code | Full rights to keep/sell code |
