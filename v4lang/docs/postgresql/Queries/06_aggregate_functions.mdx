# PostgreSQL Aggregate Functions

Aggregate functions in PostgreSQL perform calculations on a set of rows and return a single value. They are commonly used with the `GROUP BY` clause to summarize data in meaningful ways.

📊 What Are Aggregate Functions?
Imagine you own a **restaurant** and want to analyze customer orders:
- **How many orders were placed?**
- **What is the average order value?**
- **What was the most expensive dish ordered?**

PostgreSQL aggregate functions help answer these questions efficiently.

<Tabs>
<TabItem value="1" label="AVG()">

### AVG() – Average Value
Finds the **average** of a numeric column.

🔎 *“What is the average price of menu items?”*
```sql
SELECT AVG(price) AS average_price FROM menu;
```

💡 **Tip:** Exclude `NULL` values automatically unless handled explicitly.

</TabItem>

<TabItem value="2" label="COUNT()">

### COUNT() – Number of Values
Returns the **number of rows** (or non-null values) in a column.

🔎 *“How many orders were placed?”*
```sql
SELECT COUNT(*) AS total_orders FROM orders;
```

🔎 *“How many customers provided their email?”*
```sql
SELECT COUNT(email) AS provided_emails FROM customers;
```

💡 **Tip:** `COUNT(*)` counts all rows, including `NULL` values, while `COUNT(column_name)` counts only non-null values.

</TabItem>

<TabItem value="3" label="MAX()">
### MAX() – Maximum Value
Finds the **highest** value in a column.

🔎 *“What is the most expensive item on the menu?”*
```sql
SELECT MAX(price) AS max_price FROM menu;
```

💡 **Use Case:** Useful for finding top-performing products, highest salaries, or latest dates.

</TabItem>

<TabItem value="4" label="MIN()">

### MIN() – Minimum Value
Finds the **lowest** value in a column.

🔎 *“What is the cheapest item on the menu?”*
```sql
SELECT MIN(price) AS min_price FROM menu;
```

💡 **Use Case:** Identifying the least expensive items, earliest dates, or smallest values.

</TabItem>

<TabItem value="5" label="SUM()">

### SUM() – Total Sum of Values
Calculates the **sum** of all (or distinct) numeric values in a column.

🔎 *“What is the total revenue from all orders?”*
```sql
SELECT SUM(total_amount) AS total_revenue FROM orders;
```

🔎 *“What is the total revenue from unique order values?”*
```sql
SELECT SUM(DISTINCT total_amount) AS distinct_total FROM orders;
```

💡 **Tip:** Use `SUM(DISTINCT column_name)` to exclude duplicate values from the total.


🔥 Using Aggregate Functions with GROUP BY
Often, aggregate functions are combined with `GROUP BY` to analyze data by categories.

🔎 *“What is the total revenue per customer?”*
```sql
SELECT customer_id, SUM(total_amount) AS customer_revenue
FROM orders
GROUP BY customer_id;
```

🔎 *“What is the highest order amount per day?”*
```sql
SELECT order_date, MAX(total_amount) AS highest_order
FROM orders
GROUP BY order_date;
```

💡 **Tip:** `GROUP BY` helps break down aggregate calculations into meaningful groups.

🚀 Final Thoughts
PostgreSQL aggregate functions provide powerful ways to **analyze large datasets**, extract insights, and make data-driven decisions. Whether you're tracking sales, monitoring trends, or generating reports, these functions are essential tools in SQL.
