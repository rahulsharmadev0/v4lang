## What is a Class?
A **class** is a blueprint for creating objects. It defines properties (also known as fields) and methods (functions) that describe the behavior of the object.

Think of a class as a **template**. For example, if "Car" is a class, then individual cars like a Honda or a Ford are objects of that class.

### Class Declaration
In Dart, we use the `class` keyword to define a class:

```dart
class ClassName {
   // Fields (variables)
   // Methods (functions)
}
```

## Class Fields & Methods
- A **field** (also known as an instance variable) is a variable inside a class that stores data.
- A **method** is a function inside a class that performs actions.

**Example:**
```dart
class Car {
  String? brand; // Field to store the brand name
  String? model; // Field to store the model name
  int? maxSpeed; // Field to store the maximum speed

  // Method to display car details
  void showDetails() { // Method
    print("Car Brand: $brand, Model: $model, Max Speed: $maxSpeed km/h");
  }
}
```

## Getters and Setters
Getter and setter methods are the class methods used to manipulate the data of the class fields.
- Getter is used to read or get the data of the class field
- Setter is used to set the data of the class field to some variable.

**Example:**
```dart
class Car {
  String? brand; // Field to store the brand name
  String? model; // Field to store the model name
  int? maxSpeed; // Field to store the maximum speed

  // Getter method to get the brand name
  String get getBrand {
    return brand!; 
  }

  // Setter method to set the brand name
  void set setBrand(String newBrand) {
    brand = newBrand;
  }

  // Method to display car details
  void showDetails() { // Method
    print("Car Brand: $brand, Model: $model, Max Speed: $maxSpeed km/h");
  }
}
```
